# OsaVaccineTurn

Due to covid19 and the global pandemic, vaccination shifts have been established among the population.
This script checks on 'Osakidetza' health page if they have included us within the current vaccination shift.
In that case, it notifies you thought Telegram.
It checks every 2 minutes, but you can adapt as you wish.
 
Use .env file to specify sensitive information:
TIS_NUMBER, SURNAME, BIRTHDATE, CHROME_DRIVER_PATH, TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID


### Requirements üìã

Make sure to create a Telegram bot.

```
https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
```

You also need to download a driver for web browser. In my case I used Chrome web browser (v91) driver for MacOSX.
You can download your version driver at:
```
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
```

CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = '<Your chrome driver path>'
```
