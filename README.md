# OsaVaccineTurn

Due to covid19 and the global pandemic, vaccination shifts have been established among the population. <br>
This script checks on 'Osakidetza' health page if they have included us within the current vaccination shift. <br>
In that case, it notifies you thought Telegram. <br>
It checks every 2 minutes, but you can adapt as you wish. <br>
 
Use .env file to specify sensitive information: <br>
TIS_NUMBER, SURNAME, BIRTHDATE, CHROME_DRIVER_PATH, TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID


### Requirements üìã

Make sure to create a Telegram bot:

```
https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
```

You also need to download a driver for web browser. In my case I used Chrome web browser (v91) driver for MacOSX.<br>
You can download your version driver at:
```
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
```


### Installation üîß

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file to set your values:

```
TIS_NUMBER = '<Your TIS number>'

```

## Configure system ‚öôÔ∏è

It checks every 2 minutes, but you can adapt as you wish by changing the value of this line:

```
